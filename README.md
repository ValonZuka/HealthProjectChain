# HealthAndRecordChain 🏥🔗

**HealthAndRecordChain** is a blockchain-powered healthcare record management system that ensures patient data is **secure**, **tamper-proof**, and accessible only to authorized medical professionals.  
Using blockchain technology, every record is **immutable**, transparent for authorized parties, and protected from unauthorized access.

## 🌟 Why Blockchain in Healthcare?
In traditional healthcare systems, patient records are often stored in centralized databases, making them vulnerable to hacking, tampering, or loss.  
By storing records on a blockchain:
- **Immutability:** Once added, data cannot be altered or deleted without authorization.
- **Transparency:** Actions are traceable and verifiable.
- **Security:** Data is encrypted and accessible only to patients and approved doctors.
- **Patient Control:** The patient has ownership of their own records.
